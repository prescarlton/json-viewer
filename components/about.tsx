                I made this little project when I was working on another data-heavy project in which I needed to parse a lot of JSON.
                Yes, there are hundreds of perfectly fine JSON Viewers/Parsers on the internet, but I thought it'd be fun to make my own.

                I also have some other projects I'm working on. <a href="https://pcarlton.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out my website to see those.</a>
